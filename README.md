INTRODUCTION: 
Smart door lock systems have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and enhanced security features. These systems utilize modern technologies to provide efficient and secure access control to homes, offices, and other premises. In this report, we present the design and implementation of a smart door lock system using Arduino, a versatile microcontroller platform, to offer an effective solution for access control.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of a smart door lock system is to enhance security, convenience, and control over access to a property. Here are some specific goals and benefits:
1.Improved Security: Smart door locks often offer advanced security features such as encryption, tamper detection, and real-time monitoring. They can provide better protection against unauthorized access compared to traditional mechanical locks.
2.Convenience: Smart locks allow users to lock and unlock doors remotely using a smartphone app, key fob, or keypad. This eliminates the need for physical keys and enables convenient access management, especially for properties with multiple occupants or frequent visitors.
3.Access Control: Smart locks offer granular control over who can access a property and when. Users can assign temporary or recurring access codes to individuals, revoke access remotely, and receive notifications of door activity. This is particularly useful for rental properties, Airbnb hosts, or businesses managing access for employees and contractors.
4.Integration: Smart door lock systems can integrate with other smart home devices and security systems, such as security cameras, alarms, and home automation platforms. This allows for seamless automation and coordination of security measures.
5.Audit Trail: Many smart locks maintain an audit trail of door activity, recording details such as who unlocked the door and when. This can be valuable for monitoring security, tracking entry and exit times, and resolving disputes or incidents.
6.Remote Management: With remote access capabilities, users can manage their door locks from anywhere with an internet connection. This is useful for granting access to guests or service providers when away from home, as well as for monitoring and controlling access to secondary properties or vacation homes.
Overall, the objective of a smart door lock system is to provide a secure, convenient, and flexible solution for managing access to residential and commercial properties.
